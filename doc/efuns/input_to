          Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local
          function `fun' as an argument. The input line will not be
          parsed by the driver.

          Note that input_to is non-blocking which means that the
          object calling input_to does not pause waiting for input.
          Instead the object continues to execute any statements
          following the input_to.  The specified function `fun' will
          not be called until the user input has been collected.

          If "input_to()" is called more than once in the same
          execution, only the first call has any effect.

          If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line given by
          the player will not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
          (this is useful for collecting passwords).

          The function `fun' will be called with the user input as its
          first argument (a string). Any additional arguments supplied
          to input_to will be passed on to `fun' as arguments
          following the user input.
